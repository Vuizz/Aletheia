TODO:

- Implement Agent to add market data to confirmed positions.( use market_tools/market_data.py helpers )
- Implement Agent that defines trade setups based on enriched_confirmed_positions.
- Implement Agent that defines live positions.
- Implement Agent that monitors live positions.
  ? maybe stop agent at defining trade setups

- Introduce info filtering before running its through the model ( A new agent that fitlters information to define if its relevant or not )

# from webserarch we add market data >

# after that we create market positions that have a expected outlook for certain direction setups >

# we then monitor these potential market positions for entry/setup confirmation >

# these potential market positions and then either consumed or negated >

# positions that are consumed becomes trades >

# trades are monitored
